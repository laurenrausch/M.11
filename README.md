Running my website!

This website allows you to view and update a table of items that is set by the user. You can delete, view, and add items to the list by entering a view input fields.

You can run the website through Live Preview VSCode extension which will start the local server for the webpage, run it with the following keystroke:

    Ctrl+Shift+P
    Live Preview: Start Sever

From here you should be able to use the website and be able to see changes or adjustments in real time! You can also use the same URL from the live preview and use it in an actual browser page and be able to see the same result. (I recommend this method because then you can see the full page better.)

If you refresh the page, the evil circle that consumes the bouncing balls will move.

## Sources and Credits

TODO: You must credit the sources and authors of any code, libraries, or other
assets you use in your project. If you leave this section blank, your project
will be considered in violation of the Academic Honesty policy unless you truly
created everything from scratch with no outside help. If you need to use a
source that you cannot credit (e.g. a classmate's work), you must get explicit
permission from your instructor.

A simple bulleted list below is sufficient. For example:

- Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/
- jQuery: https://jquery.com/
- Background image: https://unsplash.com/photos/...
- Sound effects: https://freesound.org/people/...
- Icons: https://fontawesome.com/
- Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/
- etc.
